**Program Name (Replace with Your Program's Name)
Overview
This R program analyzes PDB (Protein Data Bank) structures using entropy and energy data. The program utilizes various machine learning and statistical techniques to provide insights, such as cluster analysis, convex hulls, and visualization using UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection). It handles both single and multi-chain PDB files and provides detailed results that can be used for further biological research, including cancer-related studies.

The program generates two main plots:

PDBid-umap-kmeans-plot.png
Prerequisites
Required R Libraries
The program depends on several R libraries, which you need to install if you haven't already. Hereâ€™s a list of the libraries used in the program:

r
Copy code
install.packages(c("bio3d", "cluster", "ggplot2", "umap", "readxl", "dplyr", 
                   "geometry", "MASS", "FactoMineR", "dbscan", "sf", 
                   "ggrepel", "neuralnet", "gridExtra", "reshape2"))
Make sure all these packages are installed in your R environment.**
