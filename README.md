# **PDB Structure Analysis Program**

## Overview

This R program performs analysis on **PDB (Protein Data Bank)** structures using entropy and energy data. It leverages various statistical and machine learning techniques to cluster and analyze structural data. The program can handle single and multi-chain PDB files, providing detailed results like silhouette scores, convex hull areas, RMSE, and SER values. Two visualizations are also generated to assist in understanding the analysis: an **Enhanced Convex Hill Plot** and a **UMAP-KMeans Clustering Plot**.

## Features

- Automatic chain selection for PDB structures with multiple chains.
- Computes important metrics like **Silhouette Score**, **Hull Area**, **PEA-Variance**, **RMSE**, **SER**, and **SER-scaled** values.
- Generates two plots:
  - `PDBid-enhanced-convex-hill-plot.png`
  - `PDBid-umap-kmeans-plot.png`
- Supports further biological and cancer-related research using PDB analysis.

## Prerequisites

### Required R Libraries

The following R packages are required to run the program. You can install them using the command below:

```r
install.packages(c("bio3d", "cluster", "ggplot2", "umap", "readxl", "dplyr", 
                   "geometry", "MASS", "FactoMineR", "dbscan", "sf", 
                   "ggrepel", "neuralnet", "gridExtra", "reshape2"))
```
## Package Descriptions:
- `bio3d`: For PDB structure analysis.
- `cluster`: For clustering algorithms.
- `ggplot2`: For data visualization.
- `umap`: For dimension reduction and clustering.
- `readxl`: For reading Excel files.
- `dplyr`: For data manipulation.
- `geometry`: For convex hull and geometry-based calculations.
- `MASS`: For Mahalanobis distance calculation.
- `FactoMineR`: For PCA analysis.
- `dbscan`: For DBSCAN clustering.
- `sf`: For minimum bounding rectangle (MBR).
- `ggrepel`: For better label placement in plots.
- `neuralnet`: For neural network computations.
- `gridExtra`: For arranging multiple ggplots.
- `reshape2`: For data reshaping.

# Generating `entropy.xls` File
Follow these steps to generate the `entropy.xls` file:

- Step 1: Access the Packing Entropy Webserver
  Go to the Packing Entropy Webserver (link to the actual webserver).
  Input your PDB ID in the designated dialog box.
  Complete the CAPTCHA and press the Submit button.
- Step 2: Download the output.txt File
  After some processing time, the server will generate an output.txt file.
Download this file to your local system.
- Step 3: Import output.txt to Excel
Open Excel and import the output.txt file.
Choose delimited when importing and set the delimiter based on the structure of the file.
- Step 4: Create a Residue Column
In the Excel sheet, create a new column titled residue.
- Step 5: Apply Formula for Bio3D-Compatible Residue Names
In the first cell under the residue column (e.g., F2), enter the following formula:

```excel
=C2&"."&B2&"."&D2
```
This will combine the chain ID, residue position, and residue name similar to Bio3D residue format.

- Step 6: Save the File as entropy-pdbid.xlsx
Once the formula is applied across all relevant rows, save the file as entropy-pdbid.xlsx, replacing pdbid with your actual PDB ID (e.g., entropy-1A2B.xlsx).



# Usage
- Step 1: Load the Program
To start the program, run the R script containing the main program code using the source() function:

```r
source("run_program.R")
```
Step 2: Execute the Program
To execute the analysis, call the `run_program` function with the following parameters:

- PDBID â€“ Protein Data Bank identifier (e.g., `"4o33"`)
- Path to the entropy file (`entropy_4o33.xls`)
- Path to the energy file (`energy_4o33.xls`)
```r
run_program(PDBID, "path/to/entropy.xls", "path/to/energy.xls")
```

# Program Behavior
- Single Chain PDB: The program will automatically execute for single-chain PDB files.
- Multiple Chains: If multiple chains are present, the user will be prompted to select a chain ID (e.g., "A" or "B").
## Output
The program produces the following outputs:
- PDB ID
- Final_result: A data frame that contains the following analysis details:
- Silhouette score
- Convex hull area
- MBR area
- RMSE
- SER and SER-scaled values
## Plots:
- `PDBID-enhanced-convex-hull-plot.png`: Convex hull and MBR area plot visualizing the structure.
- `PDBID-umap-kmeans-plot.png`: UMAP and k-means clustering plot.
Both the data frame and plots will be stored in the working directory for further analysis.

# Example
To analyze a PDB file, you can use the following example code:

```r
run_program("4o33", "/path/to/entropy_4o33.xls", "/path/to/energy_4o33.xls")
```
If 4o33 contains multiple chains, you will be prompted to select a chain:

```r
Select chain ID (e.g., A, B): A
```
# Analysis Results
The output Final_result can be used to check if the analyzed PDB location corresponds to known cancer types. Statistical metrics such as silhouette scores, ratio and scale_SER score results provide insight into protein misfolding behavior.
